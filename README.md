Repository dedicated to the project related to my PhD thesis' Journal Article

These files present a semantic registry based on the OWL-S ontology (W3C, 2023) to describe RESTful services and to put them in a repository that can support semantic search and discovery and represent all the information about the services using a machine-readable language, the OWL-DL.

This is a result coming from research dedicated to a PhD thesis carried on by Luís Antonio de Almeida Rodriguez, at Aeronautics Institute of Technology, in São José dos Campos, Brasil.
